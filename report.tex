\section{Conclusion}
JavaScript has several features that makes the language unsuitable for application development. It has a type system which masks errors, a multitude of security issues and it enables beginner programmers to start programming without knowing the language. There are some features that should never have been allowed into the language, such as the focus on global variables and the eval() function.

But JavaScript also contains some very powerful features that, if used properly, makes the language suitable for application development. These features include inheritance, closure and high level functions. All of these advanced features are not even present in JavaScript's big brother Java.

To create a well designed application in JavaScript is hard, because the language allows you to get away with poor designs. But if you use the powerful features of the language (and avoid the bad ones) it allows you to create just as good, if not better, programs as any other high level language.
