\subsection{Cross site scripting}
Cross site scripting is one of the most common security breaches today. It is a generic term describing the insertion of malicious code into a webpage. Cross site scripting is not limited to JavaScript but the language has several features that facilitate cross site scripting.

One way to insert malicious code into a web page is to trick the server into inserting the correct HTML tags into a dynamic web page. This is facilitated by the fact that JavaScript can be inserted and run anywhere on a web page by using the <script> tag. One example of this can be shown in listing~\ref{htmlinsertion} and the problem is amplified by browser makers that are trying to make sense out of broken script tags and run them. So even if the web server has some sort of protection of script inclusion, it is often insufficient.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Insertion of malicious script on the server side},label={htmlinsertion},language={html}]
<!-- the user has previously submitted his name to the application -->
<html>
<body>
<!-- Here Mr Anderson is fetched from a database-->
<p>Hello Mr Anderson</p> 
</body>
</html>
<!--malicious case, the user has entered code instead of a name -->
<html>
<body>
<p>Hello <script> evilCode();</script></p>
</body>
</html>
\end{lstlisting}

Another form of cross site scripting is the result of one unfortunate language feature. JavaScript has the ability to evaluate and run JavaScript using the eval() function. As demonstrated in listing~\ref{eval}, the eval function takes a string and runs the JavaScript code contained in it. In combination with the many global variables in JavaScript, this is disastrous from a security perspective. The use of eval() is strongly discouraged but it is still used by beginners, mainly for parsing JSON data.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Insertion of malicious script on the client side, eval().},label={eval}]
eval('var a = 5');              // creates variable a
var userInput = getJSON();
eval(userInput);                // evaluates possibly harmful input
JSON.parse(userInput);          // safe way to do the same thing
\end{lstlisting}
